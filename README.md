# Database-sqlInterpreter

For This Project, we design a SQL interpreter for the most common operators including selection, projection, join and sort<br/>
Tuple-nested loop join (TNLJ), block nested loop join (BNLJ) and sort merge join (SMJ) are implemented for join and the performance are compared<br/>
In-memory sort and external sort are compared for sort implementation<br/>
Java IO and NIO performance comparison is done<br/>
Index key (clusted and unclusted) is used for selection<br/>
Visitor Pattern is extensively used for our project<br/>
Union-find data structure is used for selection and join<br/>
Performance benchmarking is done for different join and sort algorithm
